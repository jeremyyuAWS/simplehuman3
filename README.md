💬 Core Conversational Flows
🧾 Order & Return Flow
“Where is my order?” → Order lookup module → ETA, delivery partner, tracking link.

“I want to return my trash can” → Return policy summary → Link to start return.

“Do I qualify for a return?” → Contextual policy check (e.g., days since delivery).

🔧 Product Support Flow
Product Categories Based on UI:

Trash → “Is it motion or voice control?” → Recommend fix or guide to accessory.

Cleaning (soap dispensers) → “Foaming or liquid?” → Battery check, refill guidance.

Mirrors → “Which light setting isn't working?” → Reset tip or power supply advice.

🛠️ Register & Warranty Flow
“How do I register my product?” → Collect serial #, date of purchase, product type.

“Is my soap dispenser still under warranty?” → Match model and check eligibility.

“Start a warranty claim” → Initiate ticket with optional photo upload and issue tagging.

📦 Shipping & Payments FAQ Flow
Use AI to answer queries like:

“How much does shipping cost to Canada?”

“Can I change my payment method after ordering?”

“What are your delivery time estimates for NYC?”

Topics mapped from the image:

📊 Customer 360 & Marketing Enrichment

Icon use inspired by Simplehuman’s support tiles (trash, kitchen, etc.).

AI tone: Professional, reassuring, slightly clever (but never pushy).

🧠 2. Conversation Intents Library (Simulated Dialogue Patterns)
Each product type has a reusable intent library based on user questions and desired outcomes:

yaml
Copy
Edit
intents:
  - category: Trash Cans
    questions:
      - "What's the difference between motion and voice control?"
      - "Do you have something slim for tight kitchen spaces?"
      - "How do I replace the liner?"
    responses:
      - Explain motion vs. voice use cases
      - Recommend slim open can or round step can
      - Link to refill video and liner finder
Group intents into:

🛒 Discovery

⚙️ Troubleshooting

🧼 Maintenance

🎁 Accessories

🛍️ Purchase Journey

🏗️ 3. Componentized App Modules (Modular Code Layout)
Split front-end and back-end features by function, not by flow:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
/components
  /ProductSelector
  /IntentRouter
  /ConversationSim
  /Troubleshooter
  /Recommender
  /AnalyticsLogger

/data
  /products.json
  /intents.yaml
  /sampleConversations.json
/ProductSelector: Suggests categories based on early input

/ConversationSim: Handles flow based on selected intent

/Recommender: Pulls metadata-matched product suggestions

/Troubleshooter: Hooks into repair/cleaning/how-to flows

🗣️ 4. Synthetic Conversation Library (Prewritten Flows)
Generate mock chats (Q&A or open dialogues) for each product line:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  {
    "user": "I'm looking for a trash can that opens with voice.",
    "bot": "You're probably looking for our Rectangular Sensor Can with Voice Control. It responds to commands like 'open can' and even has a liner pocket built in."
  },
  {
    "user": "Can I use regular soap in your dispensers?",
    "bot": "Our foaming dispensers work best with foaming soap. Regular liquid soap may clog the nozzle."
  }
]
Each record tagged by:

category

intent

complexity (simple/technical)

tone (conversational/technical/sales)

📈 5. Data Capture & Feedback Layer
Capture structured logs of simulated conversations for:
